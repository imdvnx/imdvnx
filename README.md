# 👋 Hey, I’m dvnx  

Getting back into coding after a break, building small Python projects, and loving the process of learning again.  

---

## 💻 Currently
- Practicing Python: functions, variables, loops, input/output  
- Building simple, fun projects  
- Growing my coding habits and productivity  

---

## 🌟 Projects
- **[Temperature Converter](https://github.com/imdvnx/temp-conv)** – Convert °F ↔ °C in the terminal.  
- More projects coming as I keep learning!  

---

## ✨ Fun Fact
I get a real kick out of turning “I haven’t coded in months” into “I just built something that works.” Small wins keep me going!
