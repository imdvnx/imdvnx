# 👋 Hey there, I’m [Your Name]  

I’m getting back into programming after taking a long break.  
I’ve realized I want to be more productive and creative with my time, and coding is my way of doing that.  

I’m starting small, building simple projects, learning Python again, and enjoying the process.  
Every little project is a win, and I love seeing my progress over time.

## 💻 What I’m Learning / Working On
- Python basics: functions, variables, loops, input/output, conditional statements  
- Writing clean, readable code  
- Small, fun projects to practice consistently  
- Building confidence and rediscovering my coding rhythm

## 🌟 Projects I’m Proud Of
- **[Temperature Converter](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME)** – My first small project back in Python: convert °F ↔ °C in the terminal.  
- More projects coming soon as I challenge myself to keep learning and building!
